You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKDOWN`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `title` is a string with no spaces (use hyphens instead). The post’s title and date are extracted from the filename, and the post’s content starts immediately after the front matter.

## Sample Post

Here's a sample “Hello World” blog post:
